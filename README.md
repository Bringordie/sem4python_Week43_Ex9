## Week43 - Ex9

Data from: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-CA.txt.gz

1. Via Docker
  <br>A. Download data from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-CA.txt.gz use of tqdm to show the installation is optional.
  <br>B. Unzip the file.

2. Print out the length of roadNet-CA.txt and find the Node ID '27'.
  <br>A. Find the neighbours of 27 and print these out
  <br>B. With this knowledge create a small Directed Graph of this data. For the neighbours that are not 'known', add these as cornors (without a connection further)
  <br>C. Find the amount of Edges of roadNet-CA.txt and Nodes and print these out

3. Visualize this data using networkx and pygraphviz

4. Now try getting the first 200 Node IDs from roadNet-CA.txt and once again create a Directed Graph. And again Nodes that do not have a neighbour set these as cornors.

Help to some of the exercises if needed: https://www.python-course.eu/graphs_python.php <br>or [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Bringordie/sem4python/master?filepath=Week43-ex09%2FWeek_43.ipynb) to see how I've done the exercises.
